Demapio
=======

Small SQL mapper for C#

### What?

It's like [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper), but smaller and more focussed.

### Why not just use Dapper?

If that works, do it. I keep having trouble with new versions of Dapper being 'smart' and re-writing my working SQL into broken SQL.

Demapio does a lot less, and aims to be small and stable rather than big and clever.
No guarantees on speed.

### How?

** TODO **
